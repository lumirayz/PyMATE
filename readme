PyMATE - Python Minimalistic and Awesome Text Editor

How to run:
 - Windows: untested, run "pymate.bat"
 - *nix: just run "pymate.sh", might have to chmod +x it.

How to install:
 - Windows: uhhhh, don't ask me
 - *nix: cp the contents of the src folder to /usr/share/pymate and make a
   symlink to pymate.sh in /usr/bin. (might want to delete pymate.bat, it's
   useless on non-windows systems.

How to configure:
 Possible locations of config files: /usr/share/pymate/pymate.conf,
  ~/.config/pymate/pymate.conf, (pymate dir)/pymate.conf or file specified with
  the -f command-line parameter.
 Configuration is ini-style, examples:
 
 editor.tab.mode = full
 editor.indent.auto = 1
 
 [editor]
  [tab]
   mode = full
  [indent]
   auto = 1
 
 [editor.tab]
  mode=full
 [editor.indent]
  auto= 1
 
 All of the above are equivalent.
