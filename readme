PyMATE - Python Minimalistic and Awesome Text Editor

How to run:
 - Windows: untested, run "pymate.bat"
 - *nix: just run "pymate.sh", might have to chmod +x it.

How to install:
 - Windows: uhhhh, don't ask me
 - *nix: cp the contents of the src folder to /usr/share/pymate and make a
   symlink to pymate.sh in /usr/bin.

Depends on: wxPython, http://wxpython.org/download.php
